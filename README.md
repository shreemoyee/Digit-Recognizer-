# Digit-Recognizer-
Okay, so getting started with Deep Learning? Image recognition? Taking up this problem: Digit Recognition is probably the easiest and the fastest way to get your hands dirty. Now python is my go to language when it comes to this domain, so here we go!
Like I said, Python is definitely the most seamless language when it comes to building machine learning models. Hence I picked up Python. However for building the following model, you'll need to have the following libraries installed:
1. pip 
2. Scipy and dependencies (python -m pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib ipython jupyter pandas sympy nose) 
3. Keras  (sudo pip install keras)
After installation, all you need is to get your hands dirty with learning Keras.

Finding just the right deep network architecture can be tricky. You have to have a killer intuition, that comes with practice of course. As a beginner, your first step is to try different architectures: deep, shallow, flat, narrow. Find the sweet spot in your validation set. Slowly you'll grow that instinct! 

Check out my code. It has step by step instructions!!

Thanks!
