# Digit-Recognizer-
Okay, so getting started with Deep Learning? Image recognition? Taking up this problem: Digit Recognition is probably the easiest and the fastest way to get your hands dirty. Now python is my go to language when it comes to this domain, so here we go!
Like I said, Python is definitely the most seamless language when it comes to building machine learning models. Hence I picked up Python. However for building the following model, you'll need to have the following libraries installed:
1. pip 
2. Scipy and dependencies (python -m pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib ipython jupyter pandas sympy nose) 
3. Keras  (sudo pip install keras)
